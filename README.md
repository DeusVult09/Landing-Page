# Landing-Page

## The goal of this project is to build a landing page from scratch using HTML/CSS fundamentals and simple UI design structure. The following topics were implemented during the project: 

- HTML – using elements like `<main>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`, `<form>`, and more
- CSS Fundamentals – styling with custom fonts, spacing, colors, and transitions
- Flexbox – used to align navigation, structure the layout etc.
- Box Model – white space, full-width sections, padding/margin and `box-sizing`
- Form Styling – a styled email subscription with simple hover interaction.

## Skills Demonstrated

- How to fix spacing issues caused by `100vw` vs. `100%` using `calc()`
- That `box-sizing: border-box` is very important to control the layout, especially when padding is used.
- Flexbox can be applied to diff. elements not just `<div>`, even with `<a>` tags.
- The importance of writing every line manually for syntax memory and `coding memory`.
- Debugging layout issues step-by-step by using browser developer tools.

## Reflection

All in all, it was an extremely useful anf fun project to do. At the beginning it was challenging because it took time and focus. I spent over 7 to structure my HTML cleanly.

Even though progress I felt slow at times, i could get the desired result even better than i expected. I'm proud of how clean and readable the final structure looks like now.

Next steps: add responsiveness with media queries, refine it even more and possibly introduce simple JavaScript interactions.
